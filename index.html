            <p>A few of my passions range from photography to coding, gaming and traveling i love traveling to new and amazing places
            like the kruger National park to israel and many many more country's/sights one of my dream places to go is 
            kenya as the photography is absolutley extrodinary and i can't wait to on day visit. <br><br> Alot of these passions motivate me beyond my wildest Dreams
            as the design and unbelievable nature of nauture it's self obligates me to explore the realm of creation and the only output for that
            is code for me. In the end i would love to get a foot into the world of tech i love backend desging/coding as the challenges you face
            are at such a extreme level but when you manage to solve the issue i don't think there are many things on this earth that can recreate that.
